# Tocsin1.0
During the Drowsiness user of computer may not shut down the system and
this is the most significant causes of battery drainage or electricity loss and
reduce the performance of the system. Every year, they increase the
amounts of battery consumption or electric loss globally because Automatic
sleep mode is not possible during the processing of multimedia files in
personal computer. In this project Tocsin, a module for Advanced
Monitoring User System is presented to reduce the battery loss and hence
increase the system safety performance. This system deals with automatic
user detection based on visual information and based on that an algorithm
will track and analyze both the user face and eyes to measure the user is
active or not.
This project has two phase:-
 Monitoring User Is active or not.
 Automatically perform the task which user set i.e shutdown mode
